# Report notebooks

These notebooks are used to generate the figures of the paper: *STEP-BY-STEP CAUSAL ANALYSIS OF EHRS TO GROUND DECISION MAKING* : 

- `0_description_albumin_for_sepsis.py`: Description of the covariates for the population (Tables 2 and apd:7).
- `1_sensitivity_albumin_for_sepsis_report.py`: Sensitivity analysis of the causal effect of albumin for sepsis. We vary the causal and statistical estimators as well as the aggregations of the features (Figures 7 and apd:13: Forest plot for the vibration analysis).
- `2_immortal_bias_albumin_for_sepsis_report`: Sensitivity analysis for the immortal time bias. We vary the blank period between inclusion and treamtent allocation(Figures 8 and apd:14).
- `3_feature_agg_sensitivity_albumin_for_sepsis_report.py`: Sensitivity analysis for the aggregation of the features (Figure apd:16).
- `4_cate_albumin_for_sepsis_report.py`: Sensitivity analysis for the heterogeneity of the treatment (Figures 9, apd:17 and apd:18).
- `5_prediction_failure_report.py`: Motivating example for the prediction failure (Figure apd:10).
