# Usage

# Installation

You can install Caumim via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/):

```shell script
pip install caumim
```

## Installation issues

- causalml is not successfully installed with poetry, use `poetry run pip install causalml` instead. 
- causalml downgrade sklearn to <=1.0.2 (December 2021). Whereas, we need sklearn>=1.1.3 for proper handling of column name in Imputers.

## Running the project

> 📝 **Note**
> All following commands are relative to the project root directory and assume
> `make` is installed.

You can run the project as follows:

### Locally via Poetry

Run:

```shell script
make provision-environment # Note: installs ALL dependencies!
poetry shell # Activate the project's virtual environment
jupyter notebook # Launch the Jupyter server
cli main # Run the project main entrypoint
```

> 📝 **Note**
> If you want to launch the jupyter notebooks directly, simply use `make jupyter-notebook`.



# Development

> 📝 **Note**
> For convenience, many of the below processes are abstracted away
> and encapsulated in single [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) targets.

> 🔥 **Tip**
> Invoking `make` without any arguments will display
> auto-generated documentation on available commands.

## Package and Dependencies Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
installed and configured.

To install the package and all dev dependencies, run:

```shell script
make provision-environment
```

> 🔥 **Tip**
> Invoking the above without `poetry` installed will emit a
> helpful error message letting you know how you can install poetry.





## Testing

We use [pytest](https://pytest.readthedocs.io/) for our testing framework.

To invoke the tests, run:

```shell script
make test
```



## Code Quality

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for our code quality
static analysis automation and management framework.

To invoke the analyses and auto-formatting over all version-controlled files, run:

```shell script
make lint
```

> 🚨 **Danger**
> CI will fail if either testing or code quality fail,
> so it is recommended to automatically run the above locally
> prior to every commit that is pushed.

### Automate via Git Pre-Commit Hooks

To automatically run code quality validation on every commit (over to-be-committed
files), run:

```shell script
make install-pre-commit-hooks
```

> ⚠️ Warning !
> This will prevent commits if any single pre-commit hook fails
> (unless it is allowed to fail)
> or a file is modified by an auto-formatting job;
> in the latter case, you may simply repeat the commit and it should pass.
>



## Documentation

```shell script
make docs-clean docs-html
```

> 📝 **Note**
> This command will generate html files in `docs/_build/html`.
> The home page is the `docs/_build/html/index.html` file.
